# Gender Security by the Dilettantes

This project was built at HackUState, Utah State Universities annual hackathon. 
Using the Clarifai api, we hacked together a image recognition security project. The current implementation uses a network connected Nest camera to recognize the gender of a person and email the admin. 
The potential of what else could be done with this project is great. We think if training were implemented, it could be used for facial recognition. 
The initial project used a built in web cam but was then upgraded to the Nest camera. Either could be used as a computer security system or a more advanced home security system.
